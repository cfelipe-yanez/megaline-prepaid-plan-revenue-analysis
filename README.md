# Megaline Prepaid Plan Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
In this project, I worked as a data analyst for the telecommunications operator Megaline. The company offers two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, and the commercial department wants to determine which plan generates higher revenue in order to optimize the advertising budget.

The analysis is based on a sample of 500 Megaline customers. The available data includes customer demographics, location, subscribed plan, call usage, text messages, and internet activity during 2018. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates higher average revenue.

This project involves calculating monthly usage, applying plan rules and overage charges, and comparing revenues using statistical hypothesis testing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy

## 📁 Dataset Description
The project uses five datasets:
- **users**: customer demographics and subscription details
- **calls**: call durations per user
- **messages**: SMS activity per user
- **internet**: web session data usage
- **plans**: prepaid plan conditions and pricing

## 📈 Results
The analysis identifies differences in customer usage patterns and revenue generation between the Surf and Ultimate prepaid plans. Statistical tests are used to determine whether the observed revenue differences are significant, providing data-driven recommendations for marketing budget allocation.
